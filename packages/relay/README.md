# ClawRelay

Always-on relay service for Discord, Telegram, and other chat platforms. Maintains persistent connections, queues incoming messages, wakes sleeping sandboxes on demand, forwards messages to the OpenClaw gateway for AI processing, and delivers responses back to the originating platform.

The relay is designed to run on a cheap, always-on VPS (e.g. a $3/mo Fly.io or Hetzner instance), while OpenClaw itself runs on more capable cloud sandboxes that sleep when idle — so you only pay for compute when messages are actually being processed.

## How it works

1. Discord message arrives via WebSocket
2. Message is queued and typing indicator starts
3. Wake manager checks gateway health (and wakes it if needed)
4. Relay connects to the OpenClaw gateway WS and authenticates via the gateway protocol
5. Message is sent as a `relay.inbound` gateway method call
6. Gateway response is delivered back to Discord as a reply

## Quick start

```bash
bun install
cp relay.config.example.json relay.config.json
# Edit relay.config.json with your values
bun start
```

## Configuration

Config is loaded from `relay.config.json` (or `RELAY_CONFIG` env) with environment variable overrides taking priority.

| Setting | Env var | Default |
|---|---|---|
| Discord token | `DISCORD_TOKEN` | required |
| Gateway URL | `GATEWAY_URL` | `http://localhost:18789` |
| Gateway auth token | `GATEWAY_AUTH_TOKEN` | required |
| Health path | `GATEWAY_HEALTH_PATH` | `/relay/health` |
| Wake enabled | `WAKE_ENABLED` | `false` |
| Wake URL | `WAKE_URL` | - |
| Health server port | `HEALTH_PORT` | `8080` |

## Deploy to Fly.io

```bash
fly launch --no-deploy
fly secrets set \
  DISCORD_TOKEN="..." \
  GATEWAY_AUTH_TOKEN="..."
fly deploy
```

The `fly.toml` is configured with `auto_stop_machines = "off"` and `min_machines_running = 1` since the Discord WebSocket must stay connected. Keep it at 1 machine to avoid duplicate message processing.
